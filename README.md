# Random Forests

Implementation of Random Forests algorithm in Java where the CART algorithm is used for single decision tree training.

Only continuous sample features are supported, while target value can be discrete for classification and continuous for function approximation.

GUI for training the random forest model is also available as well as plotting the 2D problems with predictions from a trained model.
